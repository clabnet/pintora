> A class diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects.

## A simple demo

```pintora play
classDiagram

  class Fruit {
    float sweetness
    -float age

    float getAge()
  }

  class Apple {
  }

  Fruit <|-- Apple
  Fruit <|-- Kiwi

  Container "1" *-- "many" Fruit : holds
```

## Define a class

## Class members

To declare fields and methods, you can use the symbol `:` followed by the field's or method's name.

It is also possible to group between brackets `{}` all fields and methods.

You can write type and name in any order you prefer.

```pintora play
classDiagram
  class Fruit {
    float sweetness

    squeeze()
  }

  Fruit : getAge(): float
```

### Member visibility

Define member visibility with these symbols. The notaiton is optional but it should be placed before the member.

- `+` public
- `#` protected
- `-` private
- `~` package/internal

## Relations between classes

You can define relations between classes using following symbols :

| Type    | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `<\|--` | Inheritance |
| `*--`   | Composition |
| `o--`   | Aggregation |
| `-->`   | Association |
| `--`    | Link        |

It is possible to replace `--` by `..` to have a dotted line.

```pintora play
classDiagram
classA <|-- classB
classC *-- classD
classE o-- classF
classG <-- classH
classI -- classJ
classK <.. classL
classM <|.. classN
classO .. classP
```

### Label on relations

It is possible to add a label on the relation, using `:`, followed by the text of the label.

Also, you can use double-quotes `""` on each side of the relation for cardinality.

```pintora play
classDiagram
  classA "1" *-- "many" classB : contains
  classC o-- classD : aggregation
  classE --> "1" classF
```
