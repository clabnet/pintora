# Intro

Pintora is a javascript text-to-diagrams library that works in both browser and Node.js.

Expressing your thoughts in a diagram is better than a thousand words. With the help of pintora.js, you can create diagrams with intuitive text.

Heavily inspired by [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) and [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/).
