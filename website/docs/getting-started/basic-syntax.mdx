## Diagram Syntax Structure

All Diagrams definitions begin with a declaration of the diagram type, followed by the definitions of the diagram and its contents.

For example, the DSL below specify a [Component Diagram](/diagrams/component-diagram.mdx) by the `componentDiagram` declaration.

```pintora play
componentDiagram
  [Pintora] --> [DiagramRegistry] : Get diagram by type
```

## Comments

You can add line comment with `%%` prefixed, the content in that line will not be rendered.

```pintora play
sequenceDiagram
  %% here is line comment
  %% another line comment
  A-->B: Hi there!
```
